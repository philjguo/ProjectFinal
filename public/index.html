    <p>In this era driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI), we bring you a story about technology, ethics, and the future. "The Choices of the Future" is not just the story of Eva, a tech entrepreneur, but also a story about each of us facing the challenges brought by AI. Through Eva's decisions, we explore the delicate relationship between technological progress and humanity, as well as the moral responsibilities we should not ignore in our pursuit of efficiency and innovation.

        We hope this story will inspire professionals and enthusiasts in the tech industry to think: How do we balance the power of technology with our core human values as we continue to move forward? How should we make wise and visionary decisions with the help of AI? Standing at the crossroads of human history, how should we choose?
